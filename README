### Please follow the instructons below to run NN and K_means scripts properly ###
1. Download each Python library imported in both files by using any package managers.

2. Put your music files into test and training folders making sure that each one goes to the corresponding genre sub folder.

3. Run NN.py to test Neural Network implementation, wait around 30 mins until it plots the cost function and outputs the f-score and labels on the console. 

4. Run K_means.py to test K-means implementation which takes less time to finish training and outputs the predicted values on the console.  

Have funâ€¦
